# Public/Private Boards Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to toggle their link boards between public and private visibility. Public boards can be viewed by anyone (including non-logged-in users), while private boards are only visible to the board owner.

## Features

### 1. Public/Private Toggle
- Each board now has a toggle button in the top-right corner
- Green "Public" button indicates the board is publicly visible
- Gray "Private" button indicates the board is private
- Toggle state is saved to the database

### 2. Public Board View
- New `/public` route accessible to all users
- Displays all boards marked as public
- Read-only view (no editing capabilities)
- Responsive design matching the main dashboard

### 3. Navigation
- Landing page has "Public Boards" button in navbar and main CTA
- Dashboard has "Public Boards" button in header
- Public board page shows appropriate navigation based on login status

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Added `isPublic` field to Board schema (defaults to `false`)
- New API endpoint: `GET /api/boards/public`

### Frontend Changes
- Updated `LinkCard` component with toggle button and read-only mode
- New `PublicBoardPage` component for public board viewing
- Updated routing in `main.jsx`
- Enhanced navigation across all pages

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/boards/public` - Fetch all public boards (no auth required)
- `PUT /api/boards/:id` - Updated to handle `isPublic` field

## Usage

### For Board Owners
1. Create a board as usual
2. Click the "Private" button to toggle it to "Public"
